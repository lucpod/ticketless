## What is this

This repository gives to you training material to host a day long (7 hours) workshop to teach the basics of Serverless on AWS.

During the full course of the workshop you will build a fully-fledged web application with a frontend, backend APIs powered by a database and even a work queue system for background data processing.

The application that you are going to build is the business of the future: as soon as time travel will be generally available, somebody will have the idea of allowing people to attend concerts of bands that made the history of music! You have the opportunity to start working on this business ahead of time and learn some cool technologies, so don't waste your time! 😏

Here are some screenshots of the application, to give you a feeling of what you will be building:
